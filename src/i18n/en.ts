                    fullDescription: 'I participated in a highly ambitious project that represented a great technical and organizational challenge. We started with a team consisting of two programmers and the CTO, along with the UX/UI team. The project began with the creation of a free software monolith based on NodeJS, MySQL, and Redis, using Koa as a router and Knex for the database.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'This monolith operated through a plugin system, which allowed the installation and uninstallation of additional modules besides the "core" plugins. The plugins could communicate with each other and trigger events captured by other plugins. We worked closely with the UX/UI and business teams to define and develop the best technical solutions.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'Over two years, we developed 42 plugins, of which I was responsible for 30. In addition to developing many of the plugins, I was responsible for almost the entire user and permissions base of the platform, which was a significant challenge. A single user could log in as a student, teacher, administrator, or any other role, with these being completely flexible thanks to fully manageable permissions. Once a certain level of maturity was reached, we needed to deploy the monolith to showcase the product to potential clients. I implemented a CI/CD flow using GitHub Actions to compile the monolith into a Docker image, upload it to AWS ECR, and deploy it on AWS ECS, ensuring an automated and error-free deployment process.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'Later, the business decided to transform the product into a SaaS. The monolith was not viable for this model due to the complexity of maintenance and the need for each client to manage their own plugins. We decided to migrate to a microservices architecture using MoleculerJS and Nats as the messaging system.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'I migrated the database to MongoDB with Mongoose, adapting all CRUD operations to ensure data isolation between clients, thus preventing possible information leaks. Additionally, I developed a distributed transactions system to ensure data consistency in case of microservices failures.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'I also organized and centralized the common libraries in an NPM repository, automating their update and publication through GitHub Actions. This process reviewed the changes in the packages, updated the versions in the package.json files, and updated all dependent plugins and packages, keeping the repository always up to date.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'For deployment, I modified the script that compiled the monolith into a Docker image to compile each plugin separately and upload it to AWS ECR. My colleague then launched these plugins using AWS EKS. Additionally, I created all the necessary ECR repositories using Terraform, thus ensuring efficient and reproducible infrastructure as code.' +
                        '<br/><br/>' +
                        'Additionally, I set up a parallel project using NextJS for clients to register and configure their deployment/educational center. This project allowed adding students, teachers, subjects, etc., from a centralized point for greater convenience when starting with the product.' +
